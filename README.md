# ConnectFour

If running ConnectFour and you select online, the server must be running first, so java Server, then from there you can run the game and connect the ports with your IP address entered in. 
The default port for the server is 8000.

Also, run the program from a Desktop Computer so the game will display it's full contents, the game is intended to run on a desktop computer, not on a laptop with 13 inches diagonal.
